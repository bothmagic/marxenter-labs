<h1><a name="JXComponent_Tutorial">JXComponent Tutorial</a></h1>

<p>This tutorial describes how to build your own custom components using JXComponent and XComponentUI
    to simplify the procedure and enforce standard practices for layout and configuration.</p>

<h2><a name="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>

<p>While it is not required to know anything before reading this tutorial, it will help if you have a
    fairly in-depth knowledge of Swing and how Look and Feels work, including UIResources, as well as SwingX and the
    SwingX Painters. </p>

<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>In this tutorial we will be going through the steps needed to create the JXClock, a simple component
    that displays time in a graphical manner. The clock will follow the MVC approach used by the rest of Swing providing
    default model and view implementations. </p>

<h2><a name="Getting_Started__E2_80_93_Creating_the_Controller">Getting Started – Creating the
    Controller</a></h2>

<p>The first step to making a new component is to create the controller, this is a simple class that
    should extend <code>JXComponent</code>.</p>

<pre><code>package org.jdesktop.swingx;

public class JXClock extends JXComponent {
    public JXClock() {
        updateUI();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is all we need to create a new component, notice the similarity to components that extends
    <code>JComponent</code> directly with the call to <code>updateUI()</code>. Without this
    call <code>JComponent</code> subclasses would not have their backgrounds painted, and similarly
    <code>JXComponent</code> subclasses will not have their background or foreground painters painted. </p>

<h2><a name="Get_Some_Time__E2_80_93_Creating_the_Model">Get Some Time – Creating the Model</a></h2>

<p>It's all well and good having a controller if you don't have anything to control, lets create a
    model. </p>

<pre><code>package org.jdesktop.swingx.clock; 

public interface ClockModel extends DynamicObject {
    public Calendar getTime();
} 
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the model is very simple, it contains a single method used to return a Calendar
    instance. The returned calendar should be treated as either an immutable object or as a fresh object depending on
    the implementation. Essentially any changes to the returned Calendar should not affect future calls to
    <code>getTime</code>. The reason for this rule is to ensure that proper event notification occurs for
    observers of the ClockModel, the observable interface is provided by the <code>DynamicObject</code>
    interface. This class provides the standard methods for adding and removing <code>ChangeListener</code>s
    from an object so that change notification can occur.</p>

<p>Once we have a model interface we can create our abstract base class which provides the boilerplate
    code for the majority of implementations of a <code>ClockModel</code>. This is standard practice in
    Swing and generally  will involve implementing the observer methods and providing ways of triggering events. Luckily
    for us you will find a common base class which already provides the observer functionality needed in my incubator
    space under the name <code>AbstractDynamicObject</code>. We will add a couple of other utility methods
    to the class to aid in the creation of sub classes and then we are done.</p>

<pre><code>package org.jdesktop.swingx.clock; 
     
import java.util.Calendar; 
import org.jdesktop.swingx.event.AbstractDynamicObject; 
    
public abstract class AbstractClockModel extends AbstractDynamicObject implements ClockModel { 
    protected Calendar getCalendarInstance() {
        Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance();
        return c;
    }
 
    protected Calendar unmodifiableCalendar(Calendar c) {
        return new UnmodifiableCalendar(c);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You'll notice that these two methods provide the needed functionality to either return a new
    calendar instance of return an unmodifiable calendar instance from the <code>getTime</code> method.
    <code>UnmodifiableCalendar</code> is a simple calendar instance that wraps another calendar but throws
    an exception if any attempt is made to adjust its fields.</p>

<p>The next step is to create a default implementation for the <code>ClockModel</code> so
    that it can be used easily without having to do too much work. We will write this default model to provide the most
    common use-case of a simple clock that shows the current time and updates itself when the time changes. As we want
    the model to change to show the current time we will need a periodic timer to notify us that it is time to change
    the model time. I won't go into too much detail as to the inner workings of the <code>DefaultClockModel</code> but
    will say that is is implemented in a way that decouples it from the
    specific timer used and provides predictable results between event notifications and calls to <code>getTime()</code>.
    If you want more details the source code is well documented.</p>

<p>Now that we have our default implementation of the model we can bind it to our controller by adding
    the following code: </p>

<pre><code>public class JXClock extends JXComponent { 
    // ...
    private ClockModel model;
 
    public JXClock() {
        this( -1);
    }
 
    public JXClock(long initialValue) {
        super();
        DefaultClockModel model = new DefaultClockModel(initialValue);
        model.start();
        init(model);
    }
 
    public JXClock(ClockModel model) {
        init(model);
    }
 
    protected void init(ClockModel model) {
        setModel(model);
        updateUI();
    }
 
    // ...
 
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that care has been taken to avoid problems that occur when non-private methods are called
    from within a constructor (see <a href="http://www.javaspecialists.eu/archive/Issue086.html">this java specialist
    newsletter</a>
    for why we do this). We also provide the getter and setter methods for accessing the model:</p>
<pre><code>public ClockModel getModel() {
    return model;
}

public void setModel(ClockModel model) { 
    if (model == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("model cannot be null");
    }
    ClockModel old = getModel();
    if (old != null) { // can be null when getModel is overriden or on first call.
        old.removeChangeListener(modelAdapter);
    }
    this.model = model;
    model = getModel();
    if (model != null) {
        if (modelAdapter == null) {
            modelAdapter = new ModelAdapter();
        }
        model.addChangeListener(modelAdapter);
    }
    firePropertyChange("model", old, model);
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Care should be taken when writing methods like this to respect subclasses who may override methods
    like <code>getModel</code>. We also expose the models observer implementation allowing observers to
    register interest in the controller and not have to worry about changes to the underlying model reference. This is a
    standard practice followed by most of the swing components. Some code that is not shown is the
    <code>fireStateChanged</code>, <code>add</code>/<code>remove</code>/<code>getChangeListeners</code> and the code for
    the <code>ModelAdapter</code> which simply forwards events from the model to registered observers.</p>

<h2><a name="Testing_what_we_have_so_far">Testing what we have so far</a></h2>

<p>Now we have a controller and a model we can add some temporary code to see if what we have is
    working. We create the following main method within <code>JXClock</code> and run to see the time
    displayed as text on our screen.</p>
<pre><code>    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                JXClock clock = new JXClock();
                clock.setForegroundPainter(new AbstractPainter&lt;JXClock&gt;() {
                    @Override
                    protected void doPaint(Graphics2D g, JXClock c, int width, int height) {
                        g.setColor(c.getForeground());
                        g.setFont(c.getFont());
                        Calendar cal = c.getTime();
                        g.drawString(String.valueOf(cal.getTime()), 50, 50);
                    }
                });
                clock.addChangeListener(new ChangeListener() {
                    public void stateChanged(ChangeEvent e) {
                        ((JXClock) e.getSource()).repaint();
                    }
                });
 
                new TestFrame("Clock demo", clock).setVisible(true, 300, 150);
            }
        });
    }
</code></pre>

<p>To get the clock to run we simply add a painter to the clock that will display the time and add a
    change listener that will be notified when the time changes. If all goes well we should have something that looks
    like this and will update every second: </p>

<div><img width="300" height="150" alt="" src="image01.png"/></div>
<p>It should be noted that both the foreground colour and font of the text is taken from the component
    and match the default font and colour for the rest of the look and feel. This you get for free when extending
    JXComponent, to be more specific it's what you get when you use XComponentUI which is the base class for all UI
    delegates used to display JXComponents.  </p>

<h2>Making the View - XComponentUI</h2>

<p>There are a number of steps to creating a view for our component. The first is to define the public API all
    views should implement. This is done in swing by defining an abstract base class for all UI delegates to extend,
    this base class represents what each view should be able to achieve. In the case of our clock we will not add any
    more methods than the standard ComponentUI class provides.</p>

<pre><code>package org.jdesktop.swingx.plaf;

import org.jdesktop.swingx.JXClock;

public abstract class ClockUI&lt;C extends JXClock> extends XComponentUI&lt;C> {
    public ClockUI() {
        super("Clock");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>String</code> passed to the constructor of <code>XComponentUI</code> is required and provides the prefix
    for lookups of UI properties withing the look and feels <code>UIDefaults</code> table. For example the foreground
    property will be associated with <code>Clock.foreground</code>. The generic part of the class defines what
    <code>JXComponent</code> subclass this UI delegate will be interested in and is used as the type for passing the
    source to most methods in <code>XComponentUI</code>.</p>

<p>At this point we are ready to let our controller know what its view will look like (API wise), this involves
    providing the ui class id for the view in the controller. This is as simple as adding this method to JXClock:</p>

<pre><code>    private static final String uiClassID = "ClockUI";

    @Override
    public String getUIClassID() {
        return uiClassID;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>For completeness sake we will also add the method below to allow easier use of the ui.</p>

<pre><code>    @Override
    public ClockUI getUI() {
        return (ClockUI) super.getUI();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have a base class for our clocks view we can create a basic implementation of this class. This base class
    should generally provide a default view onto the controller and model and make it easy for subclasses to create
    their own views without having to reinvent the wheel. In swing each of these basic implementations is prefixed with
    <code>Basic</code> and reside in the <code>basic</code> subpackage. We will follow this example for our basic
    implementation, we will also move the repaint and text clock support form the example above into this class where it
    belongs.</p>

<pre><code>package org.jdesktop.swingx.plaf.basic;

public class BasicClockUI&lt;C> extends ClockUI&lt;C> {
    private static BasicClockUI&lt;JXClock> SINGLETON;
    public static ComponentUI createUI(JComponent c) {
        if (SINGLETON == null) {
            SINGLETON = new BasicClockUI&lt;JXClock>();
        }
        return SINGLETON;
    }

    private Adapter adapter;

    public BaiscClockUI() {
    }

    @Override
    protected Painter&lt;? super C> createForegroundPainter(C c) {
        return new AbstractPainter&lt;C>() {
            @Override
            protected void doPaint(Graphics2D g, C c, int width, int height) {
                g.setColor(c.getForeground());
                g.setFont(c.getFont());
                Calendar cal = c.getTime();
                g.drawString(String.valueOf(cal.getTime()), 50, 50);
            }
        };
    }

    @Override
    protected void installListeners(C c) {
        super.installListeners(c);
        c.addChangeListener(createChangeListener(c));
    }

    protected ChangeListener createChangeListener(C c) {
        return getAdapter(c);
    }

    private Adapter getAdapter(C c) {
        if (adapter == null) {
            adapter = new Adapter();
        }
        return adapter;
    }

    protected void stateChanged(C c) {
        c.repaint();
    }

    @UIListener
    private static class Adapter implements ChangeListener {
        @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
        public void stateChanged(ChangeEvent e) {
            JXClock c = (JXClock) e.getSource();
            BasicClockUI&lt;JXClock> ui = (BasicClockUI&lt;JXClock>) c.getUI();
            ui.stateChanged(c);
        }
    }
}

</code></pre>

<p>There are a few new concepts within the above code and a lot of boilerplate missing. This is not to aid in
    readability, the above class is complete and will display the <code>JXClock</code> if assigned by the ui. The
    boilerplate code (i.e. <code>installUI</code> and <code>uninstallUI</code>) has been implemented for you in a manner
    that provides the most common case and allows you to override the minimum possible to customise what you need. Take
    the <code>UIListener</code> annotation applied to the <code>ChangeListener</code> <code>Adapter</code> class, this
    marks the listener as view managed (similar to how <code>UIResource</code> works) and allows
    <code>XComponentUI</code> to remove it automatically for you when the view is uninstalled. It's worth noting at this
    point that <code>XComponentUI</code> will also clean up any added components, the foreground and background
    painters, the border and the font.</p>

<p>Now that we have a basic view we can attatch it by default to the controller, to be used in the case where no other
    view has been found. We can do this in two ways, one we use the SwingX LookAndFeelAddons API to insert our own
    properties into the installed look and feels <code>UIDefaults</code> tables whenever they are populated, another way
    is to use the extension hooks provided in <code>JXComponent</code> to provide a default look implmetation for use
    when no other instance can be found. Both of these methods can be used at the same time so don't worry about
    conflicts. To provide a default view instance simply override the <code>createUI</code> method in
    <code>JXComponent</code> like so:</p>

<pre><code>    @Override
    protected ComponentUI createUI() {
        return org.jdesktop.swingx.plaf.basic.BasicClockUI.createUI(this);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>We can now replace our main method in JXClock with this to have a working demo.</p>

<pre><code>    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                new TestFrame("Clock Demo", new JXClock()).setVisible(true, 300, 150);
            }
        });
    }
</code></pre>

<p>
    Well that was a lot of work to simply get the time printed onto the screen, don't worry it was all worth it and was
    a lot less effort than it would have been to do the same without <code>JXComponent</code> and
    <code>XComponentUI</code>. In the next tutorial we'll look into creating a clock view that shows graphically what
    the time is instead of the simple string representation we have now. The clock will be inherently resolution
    independent and scalable without any extra work from us but then that's for next time.
