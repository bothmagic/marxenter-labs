    <td><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="INTRO" -->During the last months I received positive feedback about the Common Components and the JTaskPaneGroup too. Its Windows look and feel helped developers to build task-oriented applications (as seen <a href="http://common.l2fprod.com/images/powered-MobilCRM1.png">here</a> and <a href="http://common.l2fprod.com/images/powered-neuclear.png">here</a>). The JTaskPaneGroup prefers you add actions as children (it creates the hyperlinks) but is not limited to them, any Swing component can be added.

    <td colspan="2" valign="top"><p>I'm collecting all feedbacks, ideas about the JTaskPaneGroup
        and JXScrollUp here together with some answers or comments about the
        suggestions. It should help us in deciding where we want to go with the
        JXScrollUp or its replacements.</p>
      <p class="note">I like the idea of being able to have a titled, collapsable
        panel, without implying I'll have any actions or actionable content inside.

      <p>&gt; I Agree. Component must accept any other Swing component has child.<br>
      &gt; [DONE in CVS]      </p>
      <p class="note">might be nice to have collapsing in different directions--have
        title bar as a vertical bar, with panel expanding to left or to right,
        or have title on bottom. (source: <a href="http://www.javadesktop.org/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=11278&tstart=0">forum</a>)</p>
      <p>&gt; Component must support collapsing in different directions: bottom
      to top, top to bottom, right to left, left to right </p>
      <p class="note">I imagine we might have several triggers for expand/collapse:
        click icon; hover title bar or hover icon; mouse over title bar double-click
        title bar...actually, that makes me think of something else. What we
        have there is some component with a specific listener setup, attached
        to an action. We could call this &quot;trigger-action&quot;:
        the trigger is what initiates the action, and a trigger can be bound
        to a component. Trigger.onDoubleClick(titlebar, &quot;expandOrCollapseAction&quot;);
        something like that. We could stop checking for click count... (source: <a href="http://www.javadesktop.org/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=11278&tstart=0">forum</a>)</p>
      <p>&gt; Interesting but I think this Trigger mechanism can be implemented outside of the JXScrollUp subproject. However the JXScrollUp should provide an action to toggle its state. </p>
      <p class="note">I'd like to be able to use the collapsible feature without
        the title bar or button on the top right. I just need the animated pane.
        (source: l2fprod) </p>
      <p> &gt; I'm answering my own comment here. I think the collapsible feature
        should not be mixed with features like the titlebar or the left/right
        decorations. It should make it more reusable.<br>
        &gt; [DONE in CVS]
      </p>
      <p class="note">I do also like having an extended collapsable panel that
        is task- or action-oriented. I'm not sure exactly what that means except
        that there is some simple way to attach an action bundle to a task panel
        and have it &quot;display the right thing&quot;, correct?<br>
        <br>
        I
          guess one idea is we have a JXActionPanel which can be assigned an
        action bundle, and which has several default layouts (list, list + small
        icons, small icons in grid, etc.). That panel could be used in several
        places, including a collapsable parent panel--but I could also add it
        elsewhere I just want to have a list of actions available. (source: <a href="http://www.javadesktop.org/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=11278&tstart=0">forum</a>)</p>
      <p>&gt; Using the contentPane approach of the JXScrollUp this is definitely
        possible. Any container could make it in the collapsible/scrollable/sliding
        pane.</p>
      <p class="note">Last point would be--how does this tie into a stackable
        sidebar as in Netscape/Mozilla? Do you think that would be an entirely
        different component, or is it somehow related to this task/action thing?
        (source: <a href="http://www.javadesktop.org/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=11278&tstart=0">forum</a>)</p>
      <p>&gt; I do not have netscape installed but IIRC the component would share at least the JXScrollUp behavior.</p>
      <p class="note"> Has anyone any idea what it might take to get theese components working
        with JGoodies look and feels? Im considering using a couple of these
        components, bringing them in to our Spring Rich Client application..with
      JGoodies look and feel etc.... (source: <a href="http://www.clientjava.com/blog/2005/04/28/1114717641061.html#comments">clientjava</a>)</p>
      <p>&gt; Component must comply with Swing look and feel architecture. At least,
      it must implement pluggable UIs for commonly used look and feels.<br>
