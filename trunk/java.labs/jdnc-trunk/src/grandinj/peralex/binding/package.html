The Binding Layer
-----------------------------

Design Principles

(0) Only do the data movement when the client code requests it - this make life a lot easier when dealing
with some O/R mapping environments - it means that if the user clicks cancel, no updates are performed on the
data model object and the data model object is still "clean" as far as the O/R mapping layer is concerned.

(1) Make the API as simple as possible

(2) Only handle the simple bean-field <-> UI-Component mapping. Anything more complex will need a higher layer.

(3) Make the library do the work - whenever trading off client ease-of-use vs. library complexity, 
make the library do the work

(4) Check aggressively & fail early - throw an exception sooner rather than later, even if it means
expensive checks.

Architecture
-------------------

There are 2 layers - the "half-binding" layer and the "binding" layer.

The "half-binding" layer only implements the movement of data to/from the UI object.

The "binding" layer implements higher level semantics like read-only attributes, validation and
configuring UI controls.


What we don't do
----------------------

(1) "meta-data" like readonly attributes

(2) configuring the UI components .e.g. populating drop-down lists

(3) attempts to track the modified status of UI components. 
We simply update everything, and trust the model
and UI objects to correctly track when things have actually changed.

(4) Validation - this is a distraction for the binding layer, and should be performed 
either by a separate library, or by custom code that creates validators that are added
to the component.

TODO
---------

(*) How to bind tables?

(*) what swing components have I missed that need binding capabilities?

(*) another package to perform auto-configuration of stuff like validators by using annotations,
and populating drop-downs and ranges (spinner) by using a combination of annotations and type-lookups
i.e. if you're using an enum, then the range is obviously limited.

(*) a default auto-binding panel that also has update/cancel/etc buttons.
