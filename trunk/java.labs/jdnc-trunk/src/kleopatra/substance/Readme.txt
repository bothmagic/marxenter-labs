This folder contains experiments about the interplay of SwingX with
Substance and related projects. To compile, the classpath has to 
contain "recent" (meaning: the same as in my local workspace <g>) versions of

- complete swingx (including test package)
- substance
- substance-swingx
- trident

No guarantee, of course :-)
