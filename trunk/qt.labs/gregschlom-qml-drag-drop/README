QML Drag and Drop example
=========================

This is a small working example of how to add drag and drop functionality to QML

Usage
=====

Open DropArea.pro in QtCreator and launch the program. You will see a window with two squares.
Drag the red square over the blue square and watch the debug messages in the console.

General architecture
====================

The basic idea is to create two QML components, DragArea and DropArea, that act as thin wrappers
between QML and the built-in drag and drop functionnality from QGraphicsItem.
