                            Version 2.0.0
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    Since version 2.0 the JGoodies Validation uses and requires Java 5.
    It uses the enhanced for loop, enums, and annotations; classes and 
    methods have been generified where useful. This version is binary 
    incompatible with previous versions.
    
    Also, the old Validator interface has been renamed to Validatable,
    it describes objects that can validate themselves. A new Validator 
    describes objects that can validate other objects. Validator uses 
    the following signature:
        ValidationResult validate(T validationTarget).
    

OTHER CHANGES

    o Updated the Binding version used for the tutorial to 2.0.0.
    o The tutorial now uses the SwingWorker backport for Java 5.
    o The tutorial demonstrates the Validatable and Validator interfaces.
    o Source cleanup: marked fields as final, removed trailing blanks.
    o Fixed JavaDoc typos.

                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This release includes binary incompatible changes. Components
    can now be associated with multiple validation message keys.
	

CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE BINARY COMPATIBILITY

    o Added ValidationComponentUtils#setMessageKeys(Object[])
    o Replaced ValidationComponentUtils#getMessageKey by #getMessagesKeys.
    o Added ValidationResult#subResult(Object[])
    
    
CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE BEHAVIOR

    o ValidationResult#keyMap returns a Map of unmodifiable results.
      The map itself was unmodifiable before.
    o ValidationResult#subResult returns an unmodifiable result.
    o Renamed the (internal) client property key from
      "validation.messageKey" to "validation.messageKeys".
      
      
OTHER CHANGES

    o Added ValidationMessageKeysExample to demonstrate the new feature.
    o Updated the Binding version used for the tutorial to 1.3.1.

                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This release removes the deprecated ValidationCapable interface,
    introduces a few new ValidationUtils, and comes with slightly
    improved JavaDocs. The FAQ has been extended and is now online. 
    
	

CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE COMPATIBILITY

    o The deprecated ValidationCapable interface has been removed.
      Use the Validator interface instead.


NEW FEATURES
    
    To make it easier to switch between the ValidationUtils
    and the Jakarta Commons Lang StringUtils I've added:
      ValidationUtils#isNotBlank, #isNotEmpty, #isAlpha, 
      #isAlphaSpace, #isAlphanumeric, #isAlphanumericSpace, 
      #isNumeric, #isNumericSpace.
          
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o ValidationUtils#isDigit, #isLetter, and #isLetterOrDigit
      have been marked as deprecated. These methods have been
      replaced by #isNumeric, #isAlpha, #isAlphanumeric.
      The deprecated methods will be removed in version 1.3.
    o Improved implementation of ValidationUtils#isBlank.
    o Added tests for the ValidationUtils methods.
    o Added missing package documentations.
    o Added a few tutorial JavaDocs.

                         JGoodies Validation
                            Version 1.1.1
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This release fixes a minor bug and brings new tutorial examples. 
    
    The PerformanceExample demonstrates different approaches
    to reducing the validation frequency, costs, and GUI locks;
    see the package com.jgoodies.validation.tutorial.performance.
    
    The SimpleDomainValidationExample "copies" the domain values 
    to the GUI, where the other examples use the JGoodies Binding 
    to synchronize the domain with the GUI state. Also, this 
    example presents validation errors and warnings in a dialog.
	

CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE COMPATIBILITY

    o The ValidationResult methods #add and #addAll now ensure 
      that the message severity is WARNING, or ERROR, not OK. 
      This constraint is already ensured by all subclasses
      of AbstractValidationMessages, but it can be violated
      by other implementors of the ValidationMessage interface.


BUGS FIXED
    
    o Issue 15: ValidationComponentUtils shall observe L&f changes.
    
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o Updated the tutorial's Binding library to version 1.1.1.
    o The ANT build can create a Maven bundle.
    o RelativeDateFormatter initializes the default bundle lazily.
    o Corrected the JavaDocs for ValidationMessage#severity and
      ValidationResult#getSeverity.
    o Added tutorial examples for handling slow validation operations.

                         JGoodies Validation
                             Version 1.1
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance release is primarily an API cleanup that
    contains binary incompatible changes to version 1.0.
    
    The ValidationCapable interface has been renamed to Validator.
    For backward compatibility the now deprecated ValidationCapable
    is still available as an extension of the Validator interface.
    It is recommended to move your code over to Validator,
    because ValidationCapable will be removed in version 1.2.
	

CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE COMPATIBILITY

    o Renamed ValidationCapable to Validator. 
    o Moved ValidationResultModel to com.jgoodies.validation.
    o AbstractValidationMessage#setKey, severity and #text() final.
    o PropertyValidationMessage marked as final.
    o SimpleValidationMessage marked as final.
    o Removed DefaultValidationResultModel#setValidationResult0.
    o Removed the deprecated ValidationComponentUtils method
      #updateComponentTreeValidationBackground that has been replaced
      by #updateComponentTreeSeverityBackground in 1.0.2.
    
    
BUGS FIXED
    
    o Issue 11: Component background updates broken.
    o Issue 14: ValidationResultListAdapter events broken. 
    
    
NEW FEATURES

    o ValidationResults can be turned into unmodifiable versions
      using ValidationResult#unmodifiableResult(ValidationResult). 
      This is useful to ensure that results that are intended 
      to be unmodifiable reject further modifications. 
    
    
DISTRIBUTION CHANGES

    o The sources no longer ship as a source Zip archive.
      They now come in the directory structure used by the CVS. 
      This makes it easier to build the distribution using ANT.     
      If you want to attach the library sources in an IDE, 
      point to folder 'src/core'.
    o Updated the tutorial's Binding library to version 1.1.

                 JGoodies Validation, Version 1.0.3
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance release contains primarily a performance improvement.
    It can reduce unnecessary change notifications for the "result"
    property in ValidationResultModels when changing the validation result.
    This is achieved by overriding #equals in classes ValidationResult,
    SimpleValidationResult and PropertyValidationResult.
    
    Implementors of ValidationMessage are encouraged to override 
    #equals and #hashCode in their implementations.


CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE COMPATIBILITY

    o SimpleValidationMessage constructors reject null texts.
    o ValidationResult#keyMap returns an unmodifiable Map.
    
    
NEW FEATURES
    
    o Issue 13: ValidationResult#equals and #hashCode.
    o PropertyValidationMessage#equals and #hashCode.
    o SimpleValidationMessage#equals and #hashCode.
      This prevents the AbstractValidationResultModel
      from firing unnecessary property change events for
      the "result" property when changing the validation result.
      See also #firePropertyChanges(ValidationResult, ValidationResult).
      
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o Added tests for the new equality checks.
    o Updated the tutorial's Binding version to 1.0.3.

                 JGoodies Validation, Version 1.0.2
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This release primarily fixes bugs in the IconFeedbackPanel
    and the ValidationComponentUtils. It also clarifies semantics 
    of the ValidationComponentUtils#updateComponentTreeXXX methods.


BUGS FIXED
    
    o Issue  8: IconFeedbackPanel: misplaced overlay icons.
    o Issue 11: Component background updates broken.
    
    
NEW FEATURES
    
    o SimpleValidationMessage(String, Severity, Object)
    o ValidationComponentUtils#getErrorBackground()
    o ValidationComponentUtils#getWarningBackground()
    o ValidationComponentUtils#updateComponentTreeSeverityBackground()
      This new method shows a background consistent with the 
      severity annotations presented by the IconFeedbackPanel
      making it easier to switch between both visualizations.
      
      In contrast the "old" #updateComponentTreeValidationBackground
      checks for mandatory blank fields first. If a blank mandatory
      value is a warning or error in your validator, the presentation
      is inconsistent with the validation result. 
      If you don't mark components as mandatory using #setMandatory, 
      you won't notice a difference between both methods. 
          
      I consider removing this method in a future version and 
      have marked it as deprecated.
      
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o Added tests for the ValidationComponentUtils.
    o Fixed and improved a couple of JavaDocs.
    o The ComponentFeedbackExample now shows the initial
      validation state. A comment in the source explains
      how to suppress the initial warnings and errors.
    o The ComponentFeedbackExample uses the new method
      ValidationComponentUtils#updateComponentTreeSeverityBackground().

                editable and enabled state.
    o Issue 10: ValidationViewUtils visits too much text components.
    
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o Deprecated DefaultValidationResultModel#setValidationResult0.
    o Improved IconFeedbackPanel JavaDocs to clarify issue #6.
    o Updated the Binding library used in the validation tutorial.
    o Set 'build.compile.source' and 'build.compile.target' to '1.4'
      in the default.properties; build.xml honors the source setting.
    o Improved the style of the Java sources:
      + ensured consistent modifier order,
      + fixed JavaDoc tags.
