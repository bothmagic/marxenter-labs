 * over the clipboard than the TransferHandler mechanism. 
 * <p>
 * It provides basic support for handing data transfer over the clipboard via the Meta Key mechanism
 * of the XMLNoteDocument. For more enhanced support you need to create your own transferhandlers on the
 * XMLNotePane.
 * <p> 
 * This method is only called for clipboard handling of type {@link XMLNoteDataFlavor}. Not for any
 * other (e.g. <code>text/html</code> or <code>text/plain</code> flavors.
