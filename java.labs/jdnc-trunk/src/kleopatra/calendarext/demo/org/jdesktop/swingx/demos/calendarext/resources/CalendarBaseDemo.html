        Sneak preview of a potential future SwingX calendar component. The component
        is a feel-alike of the calendar part of Vista's date-time component. It's
        exceptional (as in unusual) feature is the zooming-in-time support. For zoom-out,
        click on the title text, for zoom-in click on a cell. The corresponding 
        keybindings are ctrl-up/ctrl-down. <p>
        
		Demonstrates configuration options of the calendar view component, 
		such as using SwingX Highlighters and StringValues for visual customization. <p>
		
		Currently, this component is geared to be a slave of the 
		JXDateChooser, might be sub-optimal for standalone usage.
