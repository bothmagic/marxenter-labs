Enhance your end-user MDI experience with JExplose! Extremely simple to integrate with your existing Swing
MDI products (using Swing JDesktopPane or any custom subclass), JExplose allows your end-users to easily
navigate between their JInternalFrames. <br/><br/>
Once invoked, the JExplose effect zoom out the internal frames and layout them, so that the user can see a thumbnail
of all of them, and choose the frame he wants to bring to front. A small animation can be shown to move internal frames during the effect. <br/><br/><br/>
<a href="explosed-big.jpg"><img src="explosed.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" alt="explosed" border="1" title="desktop after JExplose"/></a>
This effect not only enhance your application efficacity, but also improve your whole application
perceived quality<br/><br/>
This effect is inspired by the Expose effect which can be found on Mac OS X.<br/><br/>

JExplose is available as a small jar (less than 80kB) which can be easily integrated with your application. <br/><br/>
Finally, it doesn't do anything until it is invoked, thus not slowing your application at all. <br/><br/>

<h1>Integration</h1>
Two kind of integration are available: 
<h2>Thunder</h2>
Use this kind of integration if you have use a custom subclass of JDesktopPane you do not want to customize
for JExplose.<br/>
You just have to obtain a JExplose
instance (for example with the static getInstance() method, which returns a default
instance, or by creating a new one with the animation and layout settings you want), and then 
call the explose method with the instance of your desktop.<br/><br/>
Usually, it looks like this:<br/>
<pre>
MyCustomDesktop desktop = a;
JExplose.getInstance().explose(desktop);
</pre>
This kind of effect is slightly less performant than the second one: lightning.
<h2>Lightning</h2>
Prefer this kind of invocation if:<br/>
- you usually used JDesktopPane and can change the class you use<br/>
- are ok to subclass the custom desktop you use, to make it an explosable desktop<br/>
As you see, this kind of integration is slightly more intrusive in your code, since it require
a particular instance of desktop. But it is ok to use in most cases, and is easier and
better performing than thunder.<br/>
Usually, using the lightning invocation looks like this:<br/>
<pre>
ExplosableDesktop desktop = ...;
desktop.explose();
</pre>
<h2>Integration with your GUI</h2>
JExplose also provides:<br/>
a swing action, for instance:
<pre>
Action thunderAction = JExploseUtils.getThunderAction(desktop)
</pre>
and an easy to use key binding: 
<pre>
JExploseUtils.installThunderHotKey(desktop, KeyEvent.VK_F11)
</pre>
<br/>
You can even use the free <a href="http://www.smardec.com/products/mouse.html"/>mouse gesture
library</a> from smardec to invoke the effect on a mouse gesture (as in the demo):
<pre>
final JDesktopPane desktop = ...;
MouseGestures mouseGestures = new MouseGestures();
mouseGestures.addMouseGesturesListener(new MouseGesturesListener() {
    public void processGesture(String gesture) {
        JExplose.getInstance().explose(desktop);
    }

    public void gestureMovementRecognized(String gesture) {
    }
});
mouseGestures.start();
</pre>
<h1>Compatibility</h1>
JExplose can be used with jdk 1.3+, and has been tested under Windows XP, Linux and MacOS X.</div>
