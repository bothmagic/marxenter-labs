    <title>PHP implementation of JNLP</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <h1>PHP implementation of JNLP</h1>
  This implementation is intended to support a substantial subset of the 
  JNLP protocol on the readily available PHP platform. It requires no changes to
  Apache .htaccess as many servers restrict such access. It has been tested on a 
  Synology DS-101j NAS appliance with the latest software release.
  
  <h2>jnlp.php</h2>
  <blockquote>&lt;a href="jnlp.php?file=MyApplication.jnlp"&gt; ... &lt;/a&gt;</blockquote>
  This is the main download script. It requires a <i>file</i> argument, also 
  recognises <i>version-id</i> and other arguments normally supplied by the JNLP 
  client. If the requested file is a JNLP file, in addition to the replacement 
  of special variables ($$codebase, $$name), it also modifies any <i>href</i> that 
  does not begin with <i>http:</i> by prepending <i>jnlp.php?file=</i>. This 
  ensures that all local resources are directed via this PHP script, but remote 
  references are left unchanged.
  
  <h2>Logging</h2>
  By using <i>loggedjnlp.php</i> instead of <i>jnlp.php</i> all requests are 
  logged to a file <i>jnlp.log</i> in the same directory. The log can be 
  examined remotely by pointing your browser at <i>getlog.php</i>. This script 
  returns recent log entries relating to the same IP address with the MIME type 
    text/plain. For example:

</blockquote>
   The second column is the result of the PHP microtime() method which retuns a 
pair consisting of a floating point microseconds value followed by the integer 
seconds since 1970 (UNIX time stamp). Entries where files are delivered also 
have this timestamp at the end of the line reflecting the point where the 
transfer is complete.

<h2>Notes</h2>
The jnlpVersions.php script is used internally to resolve JNLP version 
specifications.
