<h1>Some Random Notes</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Experiments</h1>
Instead of a documentation (hope to have made more or less clear what I
intended to do in the forum's thread "Some experiments.."):<br>
<br>
All examples are in src/demo/&lt;jdnc&gt;/kleopatra, the most advanced
are AutoOverviewList/-Table - they adapt list/tabular data to a
OverviewDataModel and fed that to a form which will build and bind a
list/table as overview and the details to a nested form. <br>
<br>
Navigation across the overviewing datastructure is handled by a
dedicated class which exposes Actions to move around and enable/disable
them appropriately. The navigation is coupled to the overviewing View's
selectionModel. Reset/Submit Actions are handled by a class named
FormHandler: it enables/disables the actions in synch with form
modification and vetos navigation if dirty.<br>
<h1>Requirements<br>
</h1>
To compile, you'll need a fairly current version of JGoodies Binding and<br>
make BindingBorder public. To run correctly in all aspects, issues 78
and 86 need to be fixed.<br>
