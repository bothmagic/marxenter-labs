   title: My mother's recipe
   description: > 
                This is my mother's recipe. Everyone, German or not, loves it. It is easy to double the recipe as well. 
                I often bring it to potlucks, and we also have it at home on special occasions. 
                There are usually no leftovers, but if there are, they don't last long!
